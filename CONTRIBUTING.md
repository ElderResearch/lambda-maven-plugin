If you are interested in contributing to this project, please note that current development can be found in the SNAPSHOT branch of the coming release. When making pull requests, please create them against this branch.

A test harness has been provided which can be run with mvn test Please use this and feel free to add additional tests. Note that the basic-pom.xml file requires you to add your role arn in order to work. As such, basic-pom.xml has been added to .gitignore so that you don't accidentally commit your role to the file. If you add more pom's as part of enhancing the test suite, please remember to add them to .gitignore.
